## About The Project
This is a python project that generates and solves mazes using different algorithms. To showcase how different algorithms solve mazes GUI has been implemented using pygame. Additionally, Pygbag was utilized for running the code directly in the [browser](https://lukmiik.github.io/maze/). 

Maze are generated with Prim's algorithm. User has option to choose to find the shortest path with simplified dijkstra, dijkstra, A* algorithm or all of the above. There are also options to find all paths (backtracking algorithm) that solve the maze, fastest path and create a new maze.
